# mtv-reloaded

## What is it 
mtv-reloaded parses Youtube by a list of favorite artists and grabs the videos from the top results and stores them locally for playing. 

## Why
MTV was originally a channel devoted to playing music...now it's more centered on reality TV or something.
My goal was to replicate this locally for playing a looping series of Music videos with a pygame client so I could re-live the excitement of Music TV.
This is the "pull" component of this, while the client player aspect has not been started yet. This is actually an early Python project 
that I started to teach myself Python, so excuse the code --- it literally is a work-in-progress.
